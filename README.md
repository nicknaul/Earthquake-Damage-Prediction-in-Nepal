# Earthquake-Damage-Prediction-in-Nepal
This app is trained from the 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) Earthquake building assessment data that was comprehensively collected and uploaded in https://eq2015.npc.gov.np/#/download. This app will predict if a building, with the selected features below, will be severely damage or not if an earthquake with the same intensity will occur in Gorkha.
Note: Unzip first the nepal.zip sqlite3 file. It is imperative to run first the earthquake-damage-nepal-model-creation.py python file. Feel free to edit the values in 'X_test_nepal-damage-prediction.csv' to test the model. Result legend: 1-Severe , 0-Not Severe.
